                        Working with TEN as a digital marketing intern has been a great experience. I learnt a lot of
                        new stuff
                        and worked on different tasks which helped me understand the marketing field better.

                        I thoroughly enjoyed my internship during this pandemic situation and gained valuable experience
                        under
                        my belt. I know this internship will be instrumental in getting myself a job and it would be
                        glowing reference
                        on my CV. I was very hesitant at the time of joining TEN due to my inexperience, but now I feel
                        so happy that I was
                        able to be a part of it as it has made me so much more confident and empowered. As much as this
                        organization changes,
                        I hope that itâ€™s class remains constant.

                        TEN was my first ever experience into internship. Even though I didn't have much of an idea
                        about my responsibilities, my
                        mentors at TEN and fellow colleagues helped me a lot in making me understand my roles and were
                        very cooperative throughout.
